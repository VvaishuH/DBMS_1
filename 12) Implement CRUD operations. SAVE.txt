12) Implement CRUD operations. SAVE method. Use following Collection.
Item: Item ID, Item quantity, price, brand, discount
1. Display the count of item brand wise.
2. Dsiplay item with minimum price.
3. Display maximum discount given for item.

ement CRUD operations with a SAVE method for the Item collection and perform the requested operations, you can use a NoSQL database like MongoDB. Here are the operations:

Display the count of items brand-wise:


To impldb.Item.aggregate([
    {
        $group: {
            _id: "$brand",
            count: { $sum: 1 }
        }
    }
]);
This MongoDB aggregation query groups items by their brand and counts the number of items for each brand.

Display the item with the minimum price:

db.Item.find().sort({ price: 1 }).limit(1);
This query retrieves the item with the minimum price by sorting the items by the price field in ascending order and limiting the result to one item.

Display the maximum discount given for an item:

db.Item.aggregate([
    {
        $group: {
            _id: null,
            maxDiscount: { $max: "$discount" }
        }
    }
]);
This aggregation query calculates the maximum discount across all items in the Item collection.
