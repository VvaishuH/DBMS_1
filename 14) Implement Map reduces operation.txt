14) Implement Map reduces operation for displaying persons with same profession.
  Use: person (person_id, name, addr, profession)

To implement a Map-Reduce operation for displaying persons with the same profession using the person collection with fields (person_id, name, addr, profession), you can follow these steps:

Map Function:
The map function will emit the profession as the key and the person's name as the value. Here's the map function:

var mapFunction = function () {
    emit(this.profession, this.name);
};
Reduce Function:
The reduce function will group people with the same profession and list their names:

var reduceFunction = function (key, values) {
    return values.join(', ');
};
Execute Map-Reduce:
Execute the Map-Reduce operation using the map and reduce functions:

db.person.mapReduce(
    mapFunction,
    reduceFunction,
    { out: "persons_by_profession" }
);
This code performs the Map-Reduce operation and stores the results in the persons_by_profession collection.

Display the Result:
To display the result, you can run a simple query:

db.persons_by_profession.find();
The output will show professions as keys and the names of people with the same profession as values. For example:


{ "_id" : "Doctor", "value" : "Alice, Bob" }
{ "_id" : "Engineer", "value" : "Charlie, David" }
{ "_id" : "Teacher", "value" : "Eve, Frank, Grace" }
