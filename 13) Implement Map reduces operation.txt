13) Implement Map reduces operation for counting the marks of students.
  Use: student (roll_no, name marks, class)

To implement a Map-Reduce operation to count the marks of students in a MongoDB collection, you can follow these steps using the student collection with the given fields (roll_no, name, marks, class). The expected output will be the student's name or roll number and the total marks they have scored.

Map Function:
The map function will emit the student's name or roll number as the key and their marks as the value. Here's the map function:


var mapFunction = function () {
    emit(this.roll_no + " - " + this.name, this.marks);
};
Reduce Function:
The reduce function will sum up the marks for each student:

var reduceFunction = function (key, values) {
    return Array.sum(values);
};
Execute Map-Reduce:
Execute the Map-Reduce operation using the map and reduce functions:


db.student.mapReduce(
    mapFunction,
    reduceFunction,
    { out: "student_total_marks" }
);
This code performs the Map-Reduce operation, and the results are stored in the student_total_marks collection.

Display the Result:
To display the result, you can run a simple query:

db.student_total_marks.find();
The output will show the student's name or roll number and their total marks. For example:

{ "_id" : "101 - John", "value" : 450 }
{ "_id" : "102 - Alice", "value" : 490 }
{ "_id" : "103 - Bob", "value" : 520 }
