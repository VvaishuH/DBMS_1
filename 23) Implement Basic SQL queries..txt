23) Implement Basic SQL queries.
1.  Create table employee.
2.  Insert 10 records in table.
3. Create a view emp_vl of table employee which  has emp_id , name and dept-attributes.
4. Display name and department of employee working in Manager or Marketing department
5. Display employees who were hired earliest or latest.
6. Display name and department no of employees who are manager, market analysts. Use  
    Predicates
List employees hired in August.
 List employees who are hired after 31/12/2006.
To implement these basic SQL queries, you'll need to have access to a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or SQL Server. Here's how you can execute these queries in SQL:

Create the "employee" table:

CREATE TABLE employee (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    dept VARCHAR(50),
    hire_date DATE
);
Insert 10 records into the "employee" table:
sql

INSERT INTO employee (emp_id, name, dept, hire_date) VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', 'Manager', '2006-01-15'),
(2, 'Jane Smith', 'Marketing', '2007-08-20'),
(3, 'Alice Johnson', 'Sales', '2008-05-10'),
(4, 'Bob Brown', 'Marketing', '2010-11-30'),
(5, 'Eve White', 'IT', '2005-04-25'),
(6, 'Charlie Davis', 'Manager', '2009-09-05'),
(7, 'Grace Lee', 'Finance', '2012-03-12'),
(8, 'David Wilson', 'Marketing', '2006-08-08'),
(9, 'Olivia Martin', 'Manager', '2011-02-18'),
(10, 'Frank Harris', 'Marketing', '2004-12-22');
Create a view "emp_vl" of the "employee" table with "emp_id," "name," and "dept" attributes:

CREATE VIEW emp_vl AS
SELECT emp_id, name, dept
FROM employee;
Display the name and department of employees working in the Manager or Marketing department:

SELECT name, dept
FROM employee
WHERE dept IN ('Manager', 'Marketing');
Display employees who were hired earliest or latest:
-- Employees hired earliest
SELECT name, hire_date
FROM employee
WHERE hire_date = (SELECT MIN(hire_date) FROM employee)
UNION
-- Employees hired latest
SELECT name, hire_date
FROM employee
WHERE hire_date = (SELECT MAX(hire_date) FROM employee);
Display the name and department number of employees who are managers or market analysts using predicates:

SELECT name, dept
FROM employee
WHERE dept LIKE 'Manager' OR dept LIKE 'Marketing Analyst';
List employees hired in August:

SELECT name, hire_date
FROM employee
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM hire_date) = 8;
List employees who were hired after December 31, 2006:
SELECT name, hire_date
FROM employee
WHERE hire_date > '2006-12-31';
These SQL queries should work with most standard SQL databases. Make sure to adjust the syntax if you are using a specific database system, as there may be slight differences in SQL syntax and date functions between different database engines.
